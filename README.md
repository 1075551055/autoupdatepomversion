# Introduction

In CI (Continuous Integration, like jenkins), we will schedule to deploy the maven projects, before deployment, 
we need to update pom version manually, and then push code to central repository. "update pom version manully" will waste our much time, so need an automation tool to help us do this repetitive job. This project is the solution for this.
